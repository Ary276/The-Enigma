# The-Enigma
Hello! This is *The Enigma* ! A nice fun bot which is integral to the IISc UG'20 server. This is a bot mostly made for use on a few personal Discord servers, however there is great utility in maintaing an active GitHub repository for it to help improve it even more.

There are many features of this bot, the current updated list of commands include:
- ask : Asking a Yes/No type question
- aww : A cute response to send to make someone _blush_ or just to say Aww to something cute
- count : A feature for counting the number of messages in a Channel. This may take very long, so do not spam this command. This command is under development for message statistics
- fml : Ever felt angry, annoyed, sad or whatever and just want to say fml virtually? Here you go
- gif :  Uses Tenor GIF API to send a Gif as per search term. GIF requests are set at PG-13
- heil : Pay respect to someone
- hello : Hello! But with cuteness embeded
- henlo : Henlo!
- insult : Send innocent Shakespearen insults!
- kill : To kill someone virtually (nothing serious, just a fun thing)
- meow : meow..... (who doesn't like a cute cat)
- rant : An exclusive command for the UG'20 server members. This is to send optionally random rants
- single_tictactoe : To play Tic Tac Toe with Enigma! Try to win if you can! (Uses the Minmax algorithm)
- tgif : Sends a random GIF corresponding to one of the trending search terms
- tictactoe : Play a two player Tic Tac Toe game
- yes : Yes?

If you have ideas for new features do suggest, and feel free to highlight any issues in the code! Hope you enjoy using the Bot!
